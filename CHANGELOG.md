# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- Clean Room Group1, Clean Room Group2, and Clean Room Group3 (buttons) - These buttons correlate with the 3 preferences on the page named the same. Because of limitations within Hubitat, a dynamic dropdown cannot be provided for easier selection. Therefore, you'll need to manually enter their values. More information can be found in the [README.md's Preferences](https://github.com/TheChrisTech/Hubitat-SharkIQRobot/blob/master/README.md#preferences)
- Clean Specific Room (button) - A dropdown that provides you the ability to clean a specific room (selection via dropdown)
- Available_Rooms (state) - Will read your map, and see what rooms you have configured. Provides an alphabetized list of rooms.

### Changed
- Modified the `runPostDatapointsCmd` method to `runDatapointsCmd`. Reason is datapoints data can be returned either using POST or GET. This will prevent duplicate code for similar HTTP operations. (GET specifically needed for Getting Room information.)

## [1.0.5]

### Added

- Google Home Compatibility (Preference) - Toggle to add a 'status' state. This state displays one of four values: docked, undocked, running, or paused. This has not been fully tested, so may have some issues (I don't use Google Home).
- Additional Scheduling Log Messages - If you have both configured or none configured, an error or debug message (accordingly) will be displayed in the logs.

### Changed

- SendEvent Improvements - Created Helper method  more consistent coding.
- Updated 'switch' state - Simple 'on' or 'off' values to determine the state of your vacuum - Now visible and triggered more frequently for during button presses and updates.

## [1.0.4]

### Changed

- Fixed Driver Versioning

## [1.0.3]

### Changed

- Fixed issue with HTTP Posts (caused broken driver - Do not use 1.0.2)

## [1.0.2]

### Added

- Get Robot Info (button) - Allows this to log out Specific Firmware and Hardware revisions to the logs (as 'info' level entries). This is to help troubleshoot differences some folks are seeing with behavior with this driver.
- Info logging - Allows 'info' entries to be logged.
- Locate (button) - This allows you to locate your Vacuum in your house. Runs for 5 seconds, then stops.
